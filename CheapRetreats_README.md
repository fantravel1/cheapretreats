## 🌍 Overview

**CheapRetreats.com** is a global retreat discovery and planning platform built on one belief:

> **Healing should not be a luxury good.**

This is not:
- Goop-core wellness
- influencer retreats
- luxury shame
- pseudo-guru transformation culture

CheapRetreats is:
- fair-priced
- honest
- community-run
- simple
- non-extractive
- designed for real people

---

## 🎯 Core Reframe: “Cheap” Means Human-Scale

CheapRetreats owns the word.

It does not apologize.

Cheap here means:
- fair-priced  
- honest  
- community-run  
- simple  
- non-extractive  

Key declarations:
- “You don’t need $5,000 and a linen wardrobe to rest.”
- “You don’t need to hustle your way into healing.”

---

## 🧠 The Healing, Not Hustle Manifesto

This site needs a soul.

CheapRetreats publishes a manifesto that sets the tone:

### Hard Bans
- ❌ influencer retreats  
- ❌ pseudo-guru cult vibes  
- ❌ luxury shame  
- ❌ productivity framing  
- ❌ “transform in 3 days” lies  

### What We Believe
- rest  
- grief  
- slowness  
- safety  
- listening  
- rebuilding  

People are starving for this tone.

## 🧭 Core Product: Retreats by Need (Not Modality)

Most retreat sites organize by modality:
- yoga retreat
- meditation retreat
- breathwork retreat

CheapRetreats organizes by **human need**:

- Burnout Retreats  
- Grief Retreats  
- Depression Recovery Retreats  
- Trauma-Sensitive Retreats  
- Quiet Retreats *(No talking required)*  
- Loneliness Retreats  
- Caregiver Recovery Retreats  
- “I Just Need to Stop” Retreats  

This makes users feel seen, not sold to.

---

## 💸 Radical Price Ladders (Under $500 / $750 / $1,000)

CheapRetreats is transparent by design.

Users browse by:
- total cost  
- nights included  
- food included  
- travel realism  

No surprise pricing.
No bait-and-switch.

---

## 🛡️ The No Bullshit Healing Index™ (Trust Moat)

CheapRetreats introduces a signature scoring system.

Each retreat is scored on:
- safety  
- consent culture  
- facilitator training  
- group size  
- silence vs structure  
- accessibility  
- refund policies  
- trauma awareness  

Badge:
> **CheapRetreats Verified — Safe & Real ✔**

This protects vulnerable people.

---

## 🏡 Community-Run Retreats (Feature, Not Footnote)

CheapRetreats highlights the spaces that actually heal:

- monasteries  
- convents  
- ashrams  
- Indigenous centers  
- rural co-ops  
- nonprofit retreat houses  
- worker-owned spaces  

These are often the most powerful healing spaces — and the least marketed.

---

## 🧠 First-Time Healing Retreat Path (Massive)

Many people want healing but feel scared.

CheapRetreats offers a guided onboarding flow:

- what to expect  
- what won’t happen  
- boundaries  
- opt-out options  
- how to leave early  
- what to bring  
- emotional safety  

This lowers the fear barrier dramatically.

---

## 🌱 Normalize “Imperfect Healing” (Anti-Cult Wellness)

CheapRetreats says:

- “You don’t need to be ready.”
- “You don’t need to believe anything.”
- “You don’t need to ‘open your heart’ on schedule.”

This is bold and necessary.

---

## 🧳 Retreats That Don’t Call Themselves Retreats

A brilliant niche.

CheapRetreats features healing spaces that avoid the word:

- monastery stays  
- farm stays with rest  
- art residencies for non-artists  
- volunteer-light stays  
- silent guesthouses  
- walking pilgrimages  

Some people need healing without the label.

---

## 🤝 Sliding Scale & Work-Exchange Filters

CheapRetreats becomes a bridge, not a gatekeeper.

Filters include:
- sliding-scale pricing  
- scholarships  
- work-exchange options  
- donation-based programs  

---

## 🧘 Healing Without Spiritual Pressure

Critical differentiator.

Every retreat is tagged clearly:

- secular  
- spiritual-optional  
- religious  
- trauma-informed  
- neurodivergent-friendly  

This avoids harm and builds credibility.

---

## 📝 Honest Retreat Reviews (Not Testimonials)

No “this changed my life” fluff.

CheapRetreats reviews include:
- what was hard  
- what helped  
- who it’s not for  
- what surprised me  
- what I wish I’d known  

This is how trust is built.
